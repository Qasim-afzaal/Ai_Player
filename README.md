# 🎵 Player_ai

A Flutter application that **creates and plays AI-generated songs** using **GetX MVC architecture**.  
Built for developers who love clean code, structured architecture, and music generated by artificial intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Player_ai** is a Flutter-based AI music generator app.  
Users can input a text prompt (like *“chill lofi beat with piano”*) and get a unique AI-generated track they can play, save, and manage within the app.

The app is built on the **MVC pattern with GetX**, ensuring separation of concerns, reactive UIs, and scalable architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **AI Music Generation** — Create original songs based on text prompts.  
- 🎧 **Audio Playback** — Play, pause, and replay generated tracks.  
- 💾 **Local Storage** — Save AI-generated tracks on device storage.  
- ⚡ **Reactive State** — Managed entirely using GetX (`Obx`, `GetBuilder`).  
- 🧩 **Clean MVC Architecture** — Models, Views, Controllers, and Services separated clearly.  
- 🌙 **Modern UI** — Simple, responsive, and elegant design.

### 📂 Explanation
- **Models** — Represent data (e.g., `TrackModel`).  
- **Controllers** — Business logic & state using `GetxController`.  
- **Views** — UI components that react to state using `Obx()`.  
- **Services** — Handle API requests, storage, and audio playback.  
- **Bindings** — Inject controllers/services when routes are loaded.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| Flutter | Frontend UI |
| GetX | State management, routing & DI |
| Just Audio | Audio playback |
| HTTP / Dio | Network requests |
| Path Provider | Local file storage |
| UUID | Unique track IDs |

Add these dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  get: ^4.6.5
  http: ^1.2.0
  just_audio: ^0.9.37
  path_provider: ^2.1.2
  uuid: ^3.0.7
````

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Player_ai.git
   cd Player_ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Add your AI API credentials**

   Create a file `lib/config.dart`:

   ```dart
   const String AI_API_BASE = "https://your-ai-api-endpoint.com";
   const String AI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a music prompt (e.g., *“happy acoustic guitar tune”*).
2. `PlayerController` calls `AiService.generateSong(prompt)`.
3. `AiService` sends the prompt to your AI API → receives an audio file or stream.
4. `StorageService` saves the track locally.
5. The controller updates the reactive track list → UI updates automatically.

---

## 🧩 Example Code

### 🧠 Controller (GetX)

```dart
class PlayerController extends GetxController {
  final AiService aiService = Get.find();
  final StorageService storageService = Get.find();

  var isLoading = false.obs;
  var promptText = ''.obs;
  var tracks = <Track>[].obs;

  Future<void> generateSong() async {
    if (promptText.isEmpty) return;
    try {
      isLoading.value = true;
      final generated = await aiService.generateSong(promptText.value);
      final saved = await storageService.saveTrack(generated);
      tracks.insert(0, saved);
    } finally {
      isLoading.value = false;
    }
  }
}
```

### 🎧 View

```dart
class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
  final PlayerController c = Get.find();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('🎵 Player_ai')),
      body: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            TextField(
              onChanged: (v) => c.promptText.value = v,
              decoration: const InputDecoration(hintText: 'Enter song style...'),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 10),
            Obx(() => ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: c.isLoading.value ? null : c.generateSong,
              child: c.isLoading.value
                  ? const CircularProgressIndicator()
                  : const Text('Generate Song'),
            )),
            const SizedBox(height: 20),
            Expanded(
              child: Obx(() => ListView.builder(
                itemCount: c.tracks.length,
                itemBuilder: (_, i) {
                  final t = c.tracks[i];
                  return ListTile(
                    title: Text(t.title),
                    subtitle: Text(t.prompt),
                    onTap: () {
                      // Navigate to Player View
                    },
                  );
                },
              )),
            )
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 🔑 AI API Example

Your API endpoint should accept a text prompt and return an audio URL or base64 string.

**POST** `https://your-ai-api-endpoint.com/generate`

```json
{
  "prompt": "lofi chill with piano",
  "duration": 30
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "title": "Lofi Chill",
  "audio_url": "https://cdn.example.com/generated/lofi_chill.mp3"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests and widget tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

* [ ] Add waveform visualizer
* [ ] Add playlist support
* [ ] Integrate with Firebase for user data
* [ ] Offline caching
* [ ] Export as .mp3

---

## 💡 Best Practices

* Keep logic in **controllers**, not views.
* Use `Bindings` to initialize controllers automatically.
* Follow **MVVM/MVC hybrid** principles for scalability.
* Store tracks using `path_provider` and ensure platform permissions.
